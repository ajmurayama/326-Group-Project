# 326-Group-Project
We created an Ecommerce store that has a number of functionalities. This program is used to create a store that you can easily edit on the vendor side and the customer side. There are various classes that allow the vendors to change their inventory, product descriptions, and more. On a customer side, there is an option to add items to your cart and checkout in your preferred currency.

# How To Run 
Run this script using the Store.py script (run python3 store.py in the command line) and it shows you the welcome page, which allows you to navigate your store as desired. You can sign in as an existing customer (username: "Kanye", password: "West") or as an existing vendor (username: "Target", password: "targetpassword"). You can also register a new account or visit as a guest.
